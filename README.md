# GitHub Peer Reviews

This assignment gives us experience on how we will work in the industry. We will be following a process on how to do pull requests, peer review work, and address changes that need to be made.

## Process

In the industry, we never commit to main. Instead, we create a separate feature branch and initiate a pull request. Code will then be reviewed by a peer through comments, suggestions, and the one who initiated the pull request must apply any changes addressed. This is is an iterative process until the code reviewed is acceptable. Once correct, the PR can then be approved by the reviewer, and the separate feature branch can be merged.

## Criteria

- One person creates repo
- Different sample files needed
- Both members create a PR
- Find 5 key things to fix
- Review code (comment specific lines, etc)
- Commit and push when needed
- Merge
